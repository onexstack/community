## Find something to work on

The first step to getting starting contributing to Zero is to find something
to work on. Help is always welcome, and no contribution is too small! 

Here are some things you can do today to get started contributing:

* Help improve the Zero documentation
* Clarify code, variables, or functions that can be renamed or commented on
* Write test coverage
* Help triage issues

If the above suggestions don't appeal to you, you can browse the
[issues labeled as a good first issue] to see who is looking for help.

### Find a good first topic

There are [multiple repositories] within the Zero organization.
Each repository has beginner-friendly issues that are a great place to 
get started on your contributor journey. For example, [superproj/zero] has 
[help wanted] and [good first issue] labels for issues that don't need high-level 
Zero knowledge to contribute to. The `good first issue` label also indicates 
that Zero Members have committed to providing [extra assistance] for new 
contributors. Another way to get started is to find a documentation improvement, 
such as a missing/broken link, which will give you exposure to the code 
submission/review process without the added complication of technical depth. 

### Issue Assignment in Github (Not yet achieved)

When you've found an issue to work on, you can assign it to yourself.

* Reply with `/assign` or `/assign @yourself` on the issue you'd like to work on 
* The [zero-ci-robot] will automatically assign the issue to you. 
* Your name will then be listed under, `Assignees`.
